# Changelog

All notable changes to this project are documented here.
The format follows [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/)
and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## [Unreleased]

### Added
- The board, the rules and the clock (`frontend/src/game/`) — a polar cell grid where
  rings narrow toward the queen, three acts (forage, return, tunnel), and three motions
  (fly, dig, seal).
- Four hives of twelve, a match starting once any hive holds eight bees
  (`frontend/src/game/match.ts`).
- Solo mode — the whole match filled with bots but one seat, so the interface can be
  played before anybody has paid for anything.
- Batch runner (`sim/run.ts`) that reports whether the board is a game or a lottery.
- Tollbooth operator scaffold: `OperatorRuntime`, the BTCPay credential template,
  and eleven frozen capability UUIDs minted once and never to be changed.
- `geometry.py` — the board, ported from the client's engine, with tests that
  mirror `rules.test.ts` assertion for assertion so a drift between the three
  copies of the rules fails a build rather than a match.
- Cloudflare Pages front end: `functions/mcp.js` proxying `/mcp` same-origin, and
  a deploy workflow that self-provisions both the Pages project and the domain.
- Shared fleet contracts: `mcp-ci` composite action, the reusable release
  workflow, MCP registry publish, and Renovate against the community preset.

- The board store: five tables, every motion a single fenced statement, cells
  stored sparsely so a match starts with twenty rows rather than four thousand.
- Match lifecycle — forming, quorum, grace, ceiling, settlement — owned by the
  server so a patron's sleeping tab cannot stop the world.
- All eleven domain tools registered and live.
- `useLiveMatch`: polls the board at the cadence the server asks for, and
  simulates nothing.
- Pages: the welcome story, a public ledger of what every match raised, and an
  about page that reports the running deployment.
- A cron worker that settles matches nobody is watching. It holds no secrets.

### Fixed

- The winner's 10% now reaches the charity whenever no person keeps it. It used
  to sit `unclaimed` for ever in three cases that produce no claimant — a round
  with no winner, a round won by a simulated bee whose key stops existing when
  the swarm does, and a winner who never comes back — and a fourth that leaked
  the other way: a winner who chose to *donate* moved the prize to `donated`,
  which nothing counted anywhere, so the gift reached the charity's books as
  zero. One rule now covers all four: the winner's share belongs to the charity
  unless a person actually kept it (`charity_due`).
- Matches abandoned when the board's geometry changed are now settled instead of
  deleted. They kept their fares precisely because somebody paid them, but
  nothing ever worked out to whom the pot was owed, and the retention sweep
  removed the match and its fares a week later — so the money was not merely
  unpaid, it stopped being countable.
- A prize the charity receives is a payout leg of its own (`prize:<match>`)
  rather than being folded into the charity leg. The two fall due days apart,
  and an amount already claimed under `charity:<match>` could never be claimed
  again.
- Operator console: text left in dark-theme amber and emerald after the palette
  moved to light lavender, sitting near 1.5:1 against the card.

### Notes

- No domain tool is registered yet. Each one needs the shared board in Neon —
  cross-patron state, which is new for this fleet — and a tool that takes a fare
  and then fails is worse than a tool that is not there. The identities are
  declared now so their UUIDs are minted once.
