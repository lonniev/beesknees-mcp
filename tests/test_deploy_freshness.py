"""Horizon deploy freshness — the metadata that forces a rebuild.

Deploy-verify compares the live ``service_status`` version / git sha against
``main``. When Horizon keeps serving a cached wheel, the live probe reports the
old package version (here ``0.1.0``) with no build sha. The fleet's fix is a
package version bump plus a ``.deploy-trigger`` touch so the next push is not
byte-identical to the cached artifact.

These assertions are the headless stand-in for that probe: if either lever is
missing, CI fails the same way a stale Horizon would.
